Thanks for helping shape the Perpetual Stable Treasury.

- Open an **Issue** for design questions, assumptions, risks, or pool allowlist proposals.
- Use **Discussions** for broader coordination (eligibility, rotation, payout cadence).
- When proposing changes, include:
  - Problem statement
  - Proposed design (state changes, invariant checks)
  - Security implications
  - Rollout plan (devnet → mainnet)
- Please avoid posting implementation code here; this repo is docs-only.
