# GameStake Protocol – Funding Proposal

## Summary

GameStake enables sustainable Web3 gaming rewards through Jupiter Earn staking yields.

**The math**: $36,500 TVL = 1 player earning $3/day forever.

**The ask**: Development funding and treasury capitalization to prove the model works.

## Why This Matters

### The Problem

Every major play-to-earn game has collapsed:
- Axie Infinity: SLP token down 99%+
- StepN: GMT/GST down 95%+
- Countless others: Dead or dying

**Why?** Token emissions create inflation spirals. The math never worked.

### The Solution

Use real yield instead of printed tokens.

```
Jupiter Earn APR × Treasury TVL = Sustainable Rewards
```

No inflation. No death spiral. No Ponzi dynamics.

### Why $3/Day

$3/day is minimum wage in:
- India: ~$3/day
- Philippines: ~$3-4/day
- Indonesia: ~$4/day
- Bangladesh: ~$2-3/day

This isn't about making Western gamers rich. It's about making Web3 gaming accessible to the 4+ billion people for whom $3/day is meaningful income.

## The Math

### Core Equation

```
Daily Reward = TVL × APR ÷ 365
$3 = TVL × 0.03 ÷ 365
TVL = $36,500 per player
```

### Scale Requirements

| Goal | TVL Required | Jupiter Earn Dependency |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| 10 players | $365,000 | ~$10,950/year yield |
| 100 players | $3,650,000 | ~$109,500/year yield |
| 1,000 players | $36,500,000 | ~$1,095,000/year yield |

### Yield Sensitivity

| APR | TVL per Player | Risk Level |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| 2% | $54,750 | Conservative |
| 3% | $36,500 | Expected |
| 4% | $27,375 | Optimistic |

## Funding Request

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept

**Total**: $50,000

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Smart Contract Development | $25,000 | Treasury + distribution logic |
| Security Audit | $15,000 | Critical for trust |
| SDK + Documentation | $10,000 | Game integration tools |

**Deliverable**: Working protocol on devnet with one test game integration.

### Phase 2: Mainnet Launch

**Total**: $400,000

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Treasury TVL | $365,000 | Fund 10 player slots |
| Operations | $25,000 | 12-month runway |
| Game Partnerships | $10,000 | Onboarding 3-5 games |

**Deliverable**: Live protocol with 10 players earning $3/day from real yield.

### Total Ask: $450,000

This funds:
- Complete protocol development
- Security audit
- 10 funded player slots at launch
- 12 months of operations
- Initial game partnerships

## For Jupiter

### Why Jupiter Should Care

1. **New vertical**: Gaming brings users who aren't DeFi-native
2. **Sticky TVL**: Game treasuries are long-term deposits
3. **Showcase**: Clean example of Jupiter Earn utility
4. **Ecosystem growth**: More Solana gaming activity

### What We Need From Jupiter

- **Technical support**: Jupiter Earn CPI integration guidance
- **Visibility**: Mention in Jupiter gaming/ecosystem materials
- **Optional**: Co-funding for proof of concept

### What Jupiter Gets

- First sustainable gaming rewards protocol built on Jupiter Earn
- Case study for gaming vertical
- Ongoing TVL from game treasuries
- Association with honest Web3 gaming economics

## Return Structure

This is **not equity investment**. There are no financial returns.

Funders receive:
- **Governance tokens**: Protocol decision-making rights
- **Naming rights**: Sponsored player slots
- **Public recognition**: Founding supporter credits
- **Priority access**: Early game partnership slots

The treasury principal generates rewards for players, not returns for investors.

## Risk Acknowledgment

### Known Risks

1. **Yield dependency**: If Jupiter Earn APR drops significantly, rewards decrease
2. **Smart contract risk**: Bugs could lose funds (mitigated by audit)
3. **Adoption risk**: Games may not integrate; players may not care about $3/day
4. **Regulatory risk**: Gaming rewards may face legal scrutiny

### Failure Scenarios

**Worst case**: Zero adoption. Treasury funds can be withdrawn and returned.
**Partial failure**: Low adoption. Fewer players funded but model still works.
**Yield failure**: APR drops to 0%. No rewards, but principal intact.

Compare to token-based models where failure = total value loss.

## Timeline

| Phase | Milestone | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Funding secured | Q1 2025 |
| 2 | Smart contracts complete | Q1 2025 |
| 3 | Audit complete | Q2 2025 |
| 4 | Devnet launch | Q2 2025 |
| 5 | Mainnet launch (10 players) | Q3 2025 |
| 6 | Scale to 100 players | Q4 2025 |

## Team

**Current**: Solo founder seeking team

**Seeking**:
- Solana/Anchor developer (smart contracts)
- Frontend developer (dashboard, SDK)
- Game BD (partnerships)
- Security advisor

## Conclusion

GameStake is not a revolutionary invention. It's the obvious application of yield farming to gaming rewards, done honestly.

The math works. The model is sustainable. The question is whether anyone will fund it.

**$36,500 = 1 player. Forever.**
